## Description
This is an agent I built for the Microsoft Build 2025 Conference's OpenHack Challenage where I was a coach:

The Microsoft 365 Copilot/Teams Advanced Challenge is designed for developers ready to go beyond the basics. In this hands-on experience, you’ll build a custom engine agent solution using the M365 Agents Toolkit, integrating RAG, actions, and proactive messaging—running inside Copilot Chat or Teams.

Over four progressive checkpoints, you’ll design an intelligent pizza ordering experience that recommends options from a catalog, places the order using an external API, and tracks the order status using secondary agents or proactive flows.
